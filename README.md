# Business Problem
Bike sharing systems are a recent evolution of traditional bike rental systems, where the entire process - from membership to rental to return - is automatic. Nowadays, there is a great interest in these schemes as they play an important role in transportation, environment and health. Apart from the interesting real-world applications of bike-sharing systems, the characteristics of the data generated by these systems make them interesting for research.

One of the biggest challenges for the company to optimize the bike sharing system is to have enough bikes for the customers. If the number of bicycles is insufficient, it will have an impact on profit loss for the company and affect the level of customer satisfaction and fall the company's branding image. Meanwhile, if the number of bicycles provided exceeds so much, it will affect the company's loss due to high operational costs. Establishing the right number of bicycles to remain profitable with affordable operational costs is very important.

Based on these problems, a company with a bike sharing system business would need to have a method that is able to predict the right number of bikes to be provided for rent. The presence of information from various features such as when customers rent, rental track record in the last two years, season, temperature, etc., can increase the accuracy of predicting the number of bikes to be provided by the company, which can bring profit to the company and reduce the risk of loss, and of course maintain customer satisfaction.
